		<h1 id="big-title">BASIC GAME RULES</h1>
		<h2 id="med-title">TURNS AND ROUNDS</h2>
		<p>Every player and hostile has 1 turn per round. The initiative que is the order in which players and hostiles take their turn. After the last player or hostile in the initiative que takes their turn, the round ends.</p>


		<p>Phases of a turn are divided into movements, actions, and checks. At the beginning of a turn, a player gets 1 free action and 1 free movement. Checks are all interactions that do not require rolls, such as asking for a description of a room or talking. During a turn, players may make more movements and take more actions at the cost of Action Points (AP) this is called pushing.</p><br>

				<li>Checks</li>
				<li>Free plays</li>

			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>

		<h1 id="big-title">MOVEMENT TYPES</h1>
			<p>There are 3 speeds of player movement: walking, running, and sprinting. Each square of the game board represents a 5x5 area. Walking moves the player 1 square, running moves the player 2 squares, and sprinting moves the player 3 squares. The speed of movement affects the player’s stance during the turn at the end of the turn. Every movement after the free movement costs 1 AP tier.</p>
			<br>
			
		<h1 id="big-title">ACTION TYPES</h1>
			<p>Actions are any feats that use dice to determine the outcome. </p>

			<p><strong>FREE ACTIONS-</strong> The first action of a turn is always free. Examples include initiating combat, using skills, unlocking or hacking doors, scavenging or looting.</p>
			
			<p><strong>PUSH ACTIONS-</strong> Any actions past the first free action are push actions. Every push costs an action unit tier.</p>
			
			<p><strong>SAVING ACTIONS-</strong> Saves are actions performed in retaliation to other entities’ turns. All saves are off-turn. Every save costs an action unit tier.</p>
			<br>
		<h1 id="big-title">STANCES</h1>
			<p>A player's stance affects their melee and ranged combat rolls. Players may change their stance for free at the end of turn.</p>

		<h1 id="big-title">TIER SYSTEM</h1>
			<p>Movements, actions, and abilities can be performed on a player’s turn beyond the free actions. Players can push characters to perform more feats by using action units. Action units consist of AP and class-specific units. Pushed actions cost one action unit tier per push, with the first push costing 1 action unit, the second push costing 2 additional action units, the third costing 3 additional action units, and so on. Push tiers only accumulate on a turn-by-turn basis and reset at the end of a player’s turn. Saves made off-turn start back at tier one, costing 1 action unit for the first save and so on.</p>
